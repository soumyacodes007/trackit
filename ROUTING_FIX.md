# ðŸ”§ Routing Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. 404 Error on Page Refresh
**Problem**: When refreshing pages like `/contests` or `/hackathons`, you got a 404 error.
**Solution**: Added proper SPA (Single Page Application) routing configuration.

**Files Added/Modified**:
- âœ… `vercel.json` - For Vercel deployment (redirects all routes to index.html)
- âœ… `public/_redirects` - For Netlify deployment (fallback routing)
- âœ… Updated `vite.config.ts` - Added build optimization

### 2. Landing Page Buttons Not Working
**Problem**: "View contests" and "Get started" buttons on the landing page were not functional.
**Solution**: Added proper navigation links to the buttons.

**Files Modified**:
- âœ… `src/components/ui/animated-hero.tsx` - Added proper href links to buttons
- âœ… `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Cleaned up unused imports

## How the Fix Works

### SPA Routing Fix
When you deploy a React SPA, the server needs to serve `index.html` for all routes because:
1. React Router handles routing on the client side
2. When you refresh `/contests`, the server looks for a `/contests` file (which doesn't exist)
3. The configuration files tell the server to serve `index.html` instead
4. React Router then takes over and shows the correct component

### Button Navigation Fix
The buttons now use proper HTML anchor tags with `href` attributes, ensuring they work correctly for navigation.

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel:
1. The `vercel.json` file is already configured
2. Deploy normally - the routing will work automatically

### For Netlify:
1. The `public/_redirects` file is already configured
2. Deploy normally - the routing will work automatically

### For Railway (Backend):
1. Your backend is already configured correctly
2. Make sure CORS_ORIGIN matches your frontend URL

## Testing the Fix

After deployment:
1. âœ… Navigate to `/contests` - should work
2. âœ… Navigate to `/hackathons` - should work  
3. âœ… Refresh the page on any route - should not show 404
4. âœ… Click "View contests" button on landing page - should navigate
5. âœ… Click "Get started" button on landing page - should navigate

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your deployment platform:

**Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)**:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://trackit-production-3076.up.railway.app
```

**Backend (Railway)**:
```
PORT=5000
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-actual-frontend-url.vercel.app
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Update the `CORS_ORIGIN` in Railway with your actual frontend URL
3. Test all routes and buttons
4. The app should now work perfectly!
